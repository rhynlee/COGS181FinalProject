# About

This was a final project concerning the application of deep learning on a dataset using pytorch as taught in the course at UCSD.
Data was taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The best performing model reaches a precision of .89 on the dataset. This may be interpreted in layman terms as that the model has a 89% chance to determine that an x-ray is from a patient with pnuemonia if the patient has pneumonia. Consequently, it has a 11% chance of misdiagnosing that a x-ray from a patient without pneumonia has pneumonia.
